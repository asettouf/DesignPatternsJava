#Command Pattern

**Command Pattern: encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize other objects with differerent requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations**

*Note: instead of defining a size parameter in Remote Class, we could define a superior size and use a "null" class: a class implementing the Command interface and having an empty execute method*
