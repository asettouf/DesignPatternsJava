# DesignPatternsJava
Implementation of various design patterns in Java from "Head First Design Patterns" from O'Reilly

## Principles to follow:

* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interfaces, not implementation
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between object that interacts
* Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification
* **Dependency Inversion Principle** (of course, this is a guideline, not rules)
  - No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class
  - No class should derive from a concrete class
  - No method should override an implemented method of any of its base class
*Depend on abstraction. Do not depend on concrete classes.
