# DesignPatternsJava
Implementation of various design patterns in Java from "Head First Design Patterns" from O'Reilly

## Principles to follow:

* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interfaces, not implementation
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between object that interacts
* Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification
