#Template Method Pattern

**Definition: The template method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm
in a method, deferring some steps to subclass. Template Method lets subclasses
redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure**

*Hook methods: used to provide optional calls to subclasses*
